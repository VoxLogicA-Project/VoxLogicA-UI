## Background Knowledge

### Neuroimaging data - .nii Files

**NIfTI** files (extension **.nii**) store volumetric neuroimaging data, which can include:

- 3D structural images (e.g., MRI scans)
- 4D functional images (e.g., fMRI time series)

The image data can represent various types of brain scans, including:

- T1-weighted MRI
- T2-weighted MRI
- Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
- Functional MRI (fMRI)
- PET scans

### BraTS

**BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation)** is an annual challenge that benchmarks state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for automated segmentation of brain tumours, specifically gliomas, using multi-parametric MRI scans. It provides **expert-annotated MRI datasets** for training and evaluation of segmentation algorithms (e.g.: the 2024 BraTS challenge focuses on post-treatment glioma segmentation, introducing a new dataset of post-treatment MRI scans).

## Concepts for Frontend

### Dataset

A dataset is a collection of neurological patient cases.

Each dataset has its own directory, and must contain:

- `dataset.json`: a .json containing two fields: **name** and **layout**. The layout is used on the front-end to understand the patient's cases structure;
- **Item (patient's case)**: a directory containing the neuroimaging data (**.nii.gz files**) of a patient.

An example of a dataset directory structure is:

```
datasets/
  brats/
    dataset.json
    BraTS20_Training_001/
      BraTS20_Training_001_flair.nii.gz
      BraTS20_Training_001_seg.nii.gz
      BraTS20_Training_001_t1.nii.gz
      ...
    BraTS20_Training_002/
      ...
```

## Requirements for the Frontend

Our front-end is a visualizer for neuroimaging data, and it must allow to:

- **Browse through the items (patient's cases) of the dataset**: it is possible to scroll them and search them with a search bar. Then, it is possible to click an item to "open" it. It is possible to open up to 16 cases, but let's start with just a single one.
- **Visualize with the opened case(s)**: one of the layers must be selected to be the base image, while the others are viewed in a list and can be:
  - Selected/unselected in order to load them on top of the base image;
  - Changed the base color
  - The visualization result is visualized using Niivue;
- **A way to load a script in a new programming language and execute it on the given patient's cases**: the script together with the opened item(s) will be sent to the server, which will compute new layer(s) to visualize on top of the new image. The important aspect is that the new layers must be separated somehow from the layer present in the dataset, and we must retain an history of runs.

It must make use of the MVVM (model, view, viewmodel) paradigma.

Here's a detailed specification of the requirements based on our discussion:

# Requirements Specification

## Overview

It's a front-end application for visualizing neuroimaging data, implemented using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern in Svelte. The application provides tools for dataset exploration, case visualization, and script execution capabilities.

## Dataset Management

### Dataset Structure

- Datasets are stored in the `static/datasets/` directory for now
- Each dataset contains:
  - A `dataset.json` file specifying:
    - `name`: The dataset's display name
    - `layout`: The dataset's structure type (e.g., "brats")
  - Multiple subdirectories, each representing a patient case
- The application must support different dataset layouts, with "brats" being the initial implementation

### Dataset Browser

- Users can browse available datasets from the specified directory
- Only one dataset can be opened at a time
- Future enhancement: Support for loading local datasets

## Case Management

### Case Structure

- Each case is represented by a subdirectory within the dataset
- Cases contain multiple NIfTI files (`.nii.gz` format)
- File naming convention (for "brats" layout): `{patient_id}_{layer_name}.nii.gz`
- Non-NIfTI files should be ignored

### Case Browsing

- Display a scrollable list of available cases
- Show case names (directory names) in the list
- Provide a search bar to filter cases by name
- Allow opening up to 16 cases simultaneously (initial implementation: single case)
- Clicking a case "opens" it for visualization

## Layer Visualization

### Layer Management

- Automatically scan case directory to identify available layers
- Layer names are extracted from file names (part after the last underscore, before `.nii.gz`)
- First detected layer automatically becomes the base image
- Additional layers can be:
  - Selected/unselected for overlay on the base image
  - Customized with user-selected colors (free color selection)

### Visualization

- Implement visualization using Niivue library
- Display base image with optional overlay layers
- Support layer opacity/visibility controls

## Script Execution

### Script Interface

- Allow loading and execution of scripts to generate new layers
- Initial implementation: Mock functionality
  - Take an existing layer as input
  - Generate a new visualization layer with different coloring
  - Store generated layers in a separate `generated_layers/` directory
  - Maintain same naming convention as source files
  - Associate generated layers with original patient cases
  - The generated layers should be retrievable in subsequent sessions

### Execution History

- Persist between sessions with cleanup capability
- Store for each run:
  ```typescript
  interface ScriptRun {
  	id: string;
  	timestamp: Date;
  	scriptName: string;
  	inputLayers: string[];
  	outputLayers: string[];
  	status: 'success' | 'error';
  	error?: string;
  }
  ```

## UI Layout

### Main Structure

1. Sidebar:

   - Dataset selector (top)
   - Case list with search functionality
   - Script execution panel (bottom)

2. Main Content Area:
   - Niivue viewer
   - Layer controls panel (collapsible)
   - Run history panel (collapsible)

### Component Structure

```
src/
  lib/
    models/
      dataset.ts       # Dataset and Case interfaces
      layer.ts         # Layer management
      scriptRun.ts     # Script execution history
    viewmodels/
      datasetStore.ts  # Dataset loading and management
      layerStore.ts    # Layer state management
      scriptStore.ts   # Script execution and history
    components/
      DatasetBrowser.svelte
      CaseList.svelte
      LayerViewer.svelte
      LayerControls.svelte
      ScriptPanel.svelte
```

## Implementation Phases

1. Basic layout and dataset browsing
2. Case list implementation with search functionality
3. Niivue viewer integration with basic layer visualization
4. Layer control implementation
5. Mock script execution and history management

## Technical Considerations

- Use MVVM pattern for clean separation of concerns
- Implement persistent storage for script execution history
- Ensure proper error handling for file operations
- Maintain clear separation between original and generated data
- Support extensibility for future dataset layouts

# Notes about layer selection

Create a user interface that allows users to efficiently manage the visibility of layers across multiple patient cases. Each layer can be visualized or hidden, and layers may not be available for all cases. The UI should provide both global and selective control options.

The UI will feature a matrix where rows represent layers and columns represent cases. Each cell in the matrix will use visual indicators to show the status of each layer for each case:

- 游릭 (Green Circle): The layer is currently visualized for the case.
- 丘쀮잺 (Empty Circle): The layer is not visualized for the case but is available.
- 游댮 (Red Circle): The layer is not available for the case.

User Interaction

- Click on Circles: Users can click on a circle in the matrix to toggle the visualization status for that specific case. This allows for selective activation or deactivation of layers.
- Click on Layer Name: Clicking on the layer name toggles the layer globally across all cases where it is available. This provides a quick way to apply changes universally.

Example

Imagine you have three open cases: Case A, Case B, and Case C. Here's how the UI might look:

| Layer Name | Case A | Case B | Case C |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Layer 1    | 丘쀮잺     | 游릭     | 丘쀮잺     |
| Layer 2    | 游릭     | 丘쀮잺     | 丘쀮잺     |
| Layer 3    | 丘쀮잺     | 丘쀮잺     | 游릭     |
| Layer 4    | 游릭     | 游릭     | 游댮     |

- Layer 1: Visualized for Case B, available but not visualized for Cases A and C.
- Layer 2: Visualized for Case A, available but not visualized for Cases B and C.
- Layer 3: Visualized for Case C, available but not visualized for Cases A and B.
- Layer 4: Visualized for Cases A and B, not available for Case C.

Discarded Alternatives

- Option 1: Global Layer Control Panel Only
  - Description: A single control panel to toggle layers globally across all cases.
  - Reason for Discarding: Lacks flexibility for case-specific analysis and doesn't account for layers that are unavailable for certain cases.
- Option 2: Individual Case Layer Controls with Synchronization
  - Description: Each case has its own layer control, with an option to synchronize layers across cases.
    Reason for Discarding: More complex UI due to dual control options, and synchronization might not be intuitive for users.
- Option 3: Layer Grouping and Filtering
  - Description: Group similar layers and provide filtering options.
  - Reason for Discarding: Not applicable as layers are independent and not grouped, and filtering doesn't address the issue of layer availability.

Conclusion
The enhanced indicator system provides a clear, intuitive, and flexible way to manage layer visibility across multiple cases. It combines the benefits of both global and selective control, making it easier for users to interact with complex datasets efficiently. This approach ensures that users can quickly understand and manage the visualization status and availability of layers, improving the overall usability of the neuroimaging data UI.
